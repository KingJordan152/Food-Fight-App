# Food Fight App
This is an app that allows people to post offers for free or reduced food. Other people can scroll through these postings, make a request for the food, and pick it up on their own accord. This system is particularly helpful for the homeless population, struggling families, and newfound college students alike.

## Important Information for Programmers!
- Please refer to Expo and React Native documentation in order to get started.
- After cloning the repository, use the command `npm install` in the project's directory in order to download the required Node Modules. These are not downloaded automatically as they are included in the gitignore.
- When downloading the expo client through the command `npm install -g expo-cli`, if you encounter the error *"EPERM"*, please end the *"Adb.exe"* program via Task Manager and run the command again.
